            <h3>As a new learner on GitHub, the most significant challenge was learning how to build the entire site. You’re given nothing to help you along, just the blank Oxygen page and a keyboard. The easiest way to make it is by looking at what others have done, tutorials or be taught it in a class. Luckily, I was taught by the best. But if I wasn’t, and was on my own, YouTube tutorials would probably be the way to go. A big advantage is being able to customize the site in any way you like. No limitations; just you and the code. Granted, you need a good understanding to make insane looking sites but the possibility it there. Having a good understanding of HTML in general will be beneficial when starting web design with Oxygen. Although, it’s not necessary, as I knew nothing before this class. Another good skill to have would be debugging. You WILL have errors in your code and it’s necessary to know what causes them and how to fix them. Also, the skill of patience. Coding is not the easiest thing, there were times I wanted to put a hole through my screen. But when it finally works, seeing that green square is the best feeling. I’d like to make a better portfolio page, as it’s not the best now. Once I make an actual portfolio, I’ll update the page to accurately reflect it.
