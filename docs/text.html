            <h2>A comparison of the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe and Jane Austen</h2>
            <h2>The raw text files can be found <a href="https://github.com/GKon26/DIGIT100Project1/tree/main/docs/TextFilesForAnalysis">here</a></h2>
            <p>I decided to compare the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe and Jane Austen. Both are quite substantial in size, but I was surprised to see Austen’s complete works is much larger than Poe’s. I wanted to compare these two because both are fictional and are old.</p>
            <p>Seeing how two types of work would compare that share a similar genre and time intrigued me. In Poe’s works, the top three words that show up the most are “said” with 661 results, “time” with 593 results and “little” with 583 results. </p>
            <p>For Austen’s works, “mr” with 3132 results, “mrs” with 2541 results and “said” with 2167 results. You can tell that Austen’s works address people much more often than Poe’s by the fact two out of the top three are mr and mrs, with a total of 5,673 results.</p>
            <p>Here are the clouds of each. Both have 55 words in their respective cloud.</p>

        <p>Edgar Allan Poe’s corpus is 443,344 total words and has 22,729 unique word forms. Jane Austen’s has 784,727 total words and 15,599 unique word forms. Poe has almost half as many words, but has over 7,000 more unique word forms.</p> 
        <p> It’s very interesting for this to be the case. Poe repeats words much less often and uses unique words that don’t get used much. In Poe’s works, “time” was one of the words that popped up a lot, with the following word being to, I, the and many others.</p> 
        <p> “Time” showed up 595 times. In Austen’s, “time” was the 8th most frequent word, with 1434 results. Even though her works have almost twice as many words as Poe’s, time shows up more than   40% more often.</p> 
        <p> Personally, I expected to see "time" show up more in Poe’s works, but having a much larger sample size helps in the frequency department. I like that time shows up so much in both works even though they have nothing to do with each other.</p> 
        <p>In both TermsBerries, “said” connects to most of the other berries. "Time" is much more connected in Austen's works.</p>

            </div>
        
        <p>The usage of "time" in Poe's works fluctuates a lot, with no clear pattern. However, with Austen's works, there is a consistent rise and fall throughout the entire document.</p>

        <p>For Poe’s works, setting the terms to 3, the most popular 3Gram is “one of the” with 184 results. For Austen’s, doing the same, the most popular 3Gram is “i do not” with 438 results. Both works have a 3Gram that have a double as; "as well as" and "as soon as." </p>
        <p>Also an interesting note, "would have been" is the eighth most popular 3Gram in both works. They also both have some instance of "could not"; "i could not" and "she could not."</p>
            <p>It's strange seeing how much they have in common even though they're completely different works.</p>
