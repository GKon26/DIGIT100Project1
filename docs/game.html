            <h2>A review of the indie game Dash Maximus</h2>
            <h2>A speedrun of the game can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_7zja_xmvQ">here</a></h2>
            <h1>Dash Maximus is an extremely small game, fitting everything in a total of 12.3 megabytes. For reference, many games these days are 10s of gigabytes. Just because it’s such a small file doesn’t mean the gameplay is lacking. Sort of.</h1>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <h2>What features (or assets) are helping to create an illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and media?</h2>
            <p>The game is very quiet, as there is no music to start. You fall down a hole and when you land a music sting plays. Then the only sounds are walking, dashing and getting teleported to the next level. After a few levels a new sound can be heard when pressing buttons for turning of lasers. Once you reach the final level, suspenseful music, that includes the sting, plays the entire time you’re there. It gets annoying after a while, as this is the final and most difficult stage, so you’ll be listening to it for a while. The wall textures, rocks and lava do a good job helping you realize you’re underground in a cave system of sorts. There are also vines that grow down here, so there are signs of life. As for graphics, they are extremely simple, being pixel based. It is charming seeing such a simple game like this. With all the new games that come out now, it seems they’re all completing for the most realistic, so it’s nice to see something so simple for once.</p>

        <h2>How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and what makes the settings distinctive?</h2>
        <p>There are no settings in the game at all. The only controls are Dash (c) and left arrow to move left and right arrow to move, you guessed it, right. Escape will pause the game but that’s all the controls to my knowledge.</p>

        <h2>What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be multiple characters? Or just one character type?</h2>              
        <p> You control this astronaut and that’s all you get.</p>

        <h2>How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc?</h2>
        <p>You never really get to know the character, more so only understanding the fear and loss that they feel when coming across skeletons. Their dash ability is memorable, seeing as it’s your primary way of traversing.</p>
            
        <h2>What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters?</h2>  
        <p>There are no NPCs in this game, only skeletons that can’t be interacted with.</p>

        <h2>How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the game?</h2>
        <p>I got stuck on the last level of the game where you’re tasked with gathering a battery of sorts. This causes a laser to slowly rise, resulting in a need to get out as fast as possible. The jumps are quite tricky and I had to look up a video on how to complete it successfully. </p>

        </div>
        <h2>What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up functional things you need to get other things work?</h2>
        <p>A few levels into the game, there are buttons that turn off lasers that are in the way. As mentioned before, there is a battery type item that activates the “laser chase.” There’s not much to this game.</p>
        <div class="rowcentered">
            <div class="column2">
                <figure><img src="images/dash3.3.png" style="width:80%"/><figcaption>Button and laser</figcaption></figure>
            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <figure><img src="images/dash8.png" style="width:80%"/><figcaption>Battery</figcaption></figure>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Comment on the music and sounds in the game!</h2>
        <p>There is no music except at the end and it gets annoying after a while. The only sounds are repetitive and, just like the music, get irritating after hearing them so much. I think some ambient cave sounds and some music in the background could really help the game feel better.</p>
        <h2>Where (if ever) do you see the game comment on itself in a "meta" way as a fictional, constructed system (as a game)?</h2>
        <p>The game is small and doesn't have much time to do such a thing. Even if the game was fleshed out, I don't think it would have any meta humor or anything of the sort.</p>
        <h2>Where (if ever) do you see the game respond to or comment on our reality? Or what cultural issues from our world do you see reflected in this game?</h2>
        <p>Just like the previous question, the game is short and doesn't do such a thing. If there was more to the game, I could see it being about the "cultural issue" of exploring other planets. It's a stretch fot sure, but that is the only route I can see this game taking on a cultural issue.</p>
        <h2>Speculate: How could this game develop in the future, or what would be an improvement the developers could make in a next stage?</h2>
        <p>I would love to see this game remastered with better graphics, music and new gameplay options. The addition of new stages and abilities could help the game out. If there were more stages with no other changes, it may make the game seem stale. A variety of abilities and things to that extent would be a good addition. I could see single use items being a cool tool, with the player needed to figure out the optimal place to use it.</p>
